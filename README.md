# FinanZero-Credit-Risk-Prediction
End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for financial forecasting and credit risk analysis using XGBoost and temporal feature engineering.

The FinanZero project represents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline engineered to forecast customer loan application probabilities and optimize financial capital allocation. Facing the challenge of unstructured, messy transactional logs, I developed a workflow that solved complex CSV parsing issues and standardized mixed-language categorical data. A critical component of this architecture was the transformation of raw events into a strict temporal grid, expanding limited transactional data into a complete customer-month time series. This allowed for the creation of advanced vectorized features—including rolling trends, cumulative history, and financial ratios, while strictly utilizing forward-filling techniques to eliminate data leakage. The solution deployed an XGBoost classifier validated through a time-series split strategy, where feature importance analysis (Gain vs. Weight) confirmed that the model correctly prioritizes historical behavioral patterns over static demographics, resulting in a stable and operationally viable forecasting tool.
